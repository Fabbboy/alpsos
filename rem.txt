Enter build environment:

    Linux or MacOS: docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)":/root/env myos-buildenv
    Windows (CMD): docker run --rm -it -v "%cd%":/root/env myos-buildenv
    Windows (PowerShell): docker run --rm -it -v "${pwd}:/root/env" myos-buildenv
    Please use the linux command if you are using WSL, msys2 or git bash
    NOTE: If you are having trouble with an unshared drive, ensure your docker daemon has access to the drive you're development environment is in. For Docker Desktop, this is in "Settings > Shared Drives" or "Settings > Resources > File Sharing".

Build for x86 (other architectures may come in the future):

    make build-x86_64
    If you are using Qemu, please close it before running this command to prevent errors.

To leave the build environment, enter exit.
